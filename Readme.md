4. Segment the customers based on the age, gender, interest. Customer segmentation is an important practise of
dividing customers base into individual groups that are similar. It is useful in customised marketing.

5. Build a model can be used to differentiate healthy people from people having Parkinson’s disease. The algorithm
that is useful for this purpose is XGboost which stands for extreme gradient boosting, it is based on decision
trees.

6. Perform various different machine learning algorithms like regression, decision tree, random forests, etc and
differentiate between the models and analyse their performances on wine quality dataset.
